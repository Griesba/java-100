#String Subsequences

Given two strings, determine the number of times the first one appears as subsequence in the second one. 
A subsequence is created by eliminating any number of characters from a string (possibly 0) without changing the order of the characters retained.

Example :
s1 = "ABC"
s2 = "ABCBABC"
The string s1 appears 5 times as a subsequence in s2 at 1-indexed positions of (1,2,3), (1,2,7), (1,4,7), (1,6,7) and (5,6,7).
The answer is 5.
